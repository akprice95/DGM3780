What makes a website successful? To me, websites become successful because the design works are appealing to the user. The problem is finding what the user really wants and how to design it for them. Designing a website is challenging and there’s a lot of failed attempts but it’s a process. Designing a website take many hours of coming up with ideas, research, sketching, prototyping and testing the ideas.

Utah State Poetry Society(UTSPS) approached us for help with updating the design of their current website, as it was outdated and not fulfilling the needs of their current users. As we studied their current design we found it very difficult to navigate, and too much information being displayed, almost overwhelming the user with so much content. Their goal of reaching out to the younger generation was going to be impossible with the approach they were currently using. We needed to think how to satisfy not only the current users, but also how to attract the younger generation.

> “For those who love poetry it is important to share and collaborate with ?like- minded individuals. For the younger generation, this collaborative critique may not be appealing. An alternative to attract younger audiences may be increased social media interactions. The site needs to be renovated for a simpler user experience and to gain younger audiences. It also needs to connect chapters, be responsive, and have clear content hierarchy.”

Our first goal for the site was to make it responsive on mobile devices. We knew that it needed to be more simple by adding more white space, organizing the content better, and setting up a system for good information architecture. We needed to be consistent across the board with all pages, so when the current users came to the website, they would recognize the site. We would do this by structuring, Branding, and using a good style guide. Since our current users were mostly older, we needed to make the site easy to use, and for the user to be able to learn how to use the site, so when they came back it was easy to navigate.
